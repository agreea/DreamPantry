====Dream Pantry====

Dream Pantry is a java app that allows housemates to split the cost of an 
order of groceries down to the item.
It takes a grocery receipt in xls format, with names in the cells next to
the item information (see the .xls for an example).
It then outputs itemized receipts: one for each person whose name shows up in the input receipt.
